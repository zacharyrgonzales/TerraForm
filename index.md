# Terraform Usuage
Terraform is a tool that simplifies the underlying complexity for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure. 

## Getting Started
Create an AWS account, go to console management then IAM, create a new user account with administrator privilages and save the AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key for later use.

Install Git and add to path:
```
https://git-scm.com/downloads
```

Install visual studio code and add to path:
```
https://code.visualstudio.com/
```

Open Visual Studio code and select:
```
Terminal > New Terminal Window
```

To clone the project on your local machine please run the following in a terminal using git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zacharyrgonzales/TerraForm.git
```

See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them
```
Terraform 11.14
AWS CLI
VSCode
Git
```

### Installing Terraform

Install Terraform on Ubuntu, OS X, or Windows and add to path:
```
https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.11.14/
```
Verify that Terraform accepts commands:
```
terraform --version
```
You should the terraform version number as a result if installed correctly and added to path:
```
Terraform v0.11.14
```
### Installing AWS CLI

Install AWS CLI on Ubuntu, OS X, or Windows and add to path:
```
https://aws.amazon.com/cli/
```
Verify that AWS CLI accepts commands:
```
aws --version
```
You should the aws cli version number as a result if installed correctly and added to path:
```
aws-cli/1.14.44 Python/3.6.9 Linux/5.3.0-51-generic botocore/1.8.48
```

### Configure AWS

Login to your account using the CLI:
```
aws configure
```
Enter in your AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key. Leave region and output format default (blank):
```
AWS Access Key ID [****************]: ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS Secret Access Key[****************]: SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
Default region name [us-east-1]: 
Default output format [None]: 
```

### Terraform Init

the ```terraform init``` command performs several different initialization steps in order to prepare a working directory for use (.terraform directory). More details in the [link provided](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/init.html#usage), but in most cases it is not necessary to worry about these individual steps.

Change directory to the Modules-Example folder:
```
cd Modules-Example
```
Initialize terraform (initialzes modules and provider plugs):
```
terraform init
```
You should see:
```
Terraform has been successfully initialized!
```

### Terraform Plan

The ```terraform plan``` command is used to create an execution plan. Terraform performs a refresh, unless explicitly disabled, and then determines what actions are necessary to achieve the desired state specified in the configuration files. More information on [terraform plan](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/plan.html#usage).

View terraform plan:
```
terraform plan
```
You should see something like this:
```
Plan: 3 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
```

### Terraform Apply

The ```terraform apply```command is used to apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration, or the pre-determined set of actions generated by a terraform plan execution plan. More information on [terraform apply](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/apply.html#usage).

Apply terraform plan:
```
terraform apply
```
Then type in ```yes``` and select enter.

You can also skip approval by using:
```
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

You should see:
```
Apply complete! Resources: 3 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

### Terraform Destroy

The ```terraform destroy``` command is used to destroy the Terraform-managed infrastructure. More information on [terraform destroy](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/destroy.html#usage).

Destroy managed infrastructure:
```
terraform destroy
```
Then type in ```yes``` and select enter.

You can also skip approval by using:
```
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```
You should see:
```
Destroy complete! Resources: 3 destroyed.
```

### Terraform State

Terraform must store state about your managed infrastructure and configuration. This state is used by Terraform to map real world resources to your configuration, keep track of metadata, and to improve performance for large infrastructures. More information on [*Terraform State*](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/index.html).

Terraform state is held in [*terraform.tfstate*]() which is the current state of terraform. *terraform.tfstate.backup* is the previous state. If you look at the [*terraform.tfstate.backup*]() file you will see all the metadata for the EC2 machines that were provisioned. In *terraform.tfstate* after destroying the managed infrastructure the dependencies are removed.

## Acknowledgments

* I started using Terraform while studying for AWS Solutions Architect exam I found it helpful to do apply a structured learning pattern that consisted of watching, trying, and educating others to help solidify my assumptions around Cloud/DevOps tools and culture. As a result it helped me become a better technologist by not only learning the tools and culture but by also giving back to the community by explaining technology in layman's terms. Therefore I hope these Terraform scripts provide value. If you have any questions please reach me on Linkedin at https://www.linkedin.com/in/zrg/.
